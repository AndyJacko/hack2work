DWP - Hack2Work - Hackathon - Sample Prototype...

This was a simple prototype I made to let customers update their skills to be automatically matched with new jobs using AI...

The hackathon was a 3 day event held from 6-8 July 2021...The reason for the hackathon was to innovate new ways of helping jobseekers back into work...

I only had a few hours to create this prototype (on my own) and used the LAMP Stack (PHP/MySQL) to achieve this...In an ideal world and given more time this would have been made using modern JavaScript frameworks like React/Angular and NodeJS/mongoDB...
